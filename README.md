# Live-Project-Unreal-Engine

## Introduction:

For the last two weeks with the Tech Academy I worked on a Live Project in Unreal Engine 4 which simulated a real world work environment in which I worked with staff on a level for a 3D puzzle and trap games located within a dungeon. I worked on a few stories in which I created my own level from the ground up, designing everything from the layout of the level to the puzzles and traps and their functionality. Below are some code snippets of the stories I worked on, full code files are also available in this repository.
